# Knocktober
Knocktober was a popular Data Science competition organised by Analytics Vidhya. This competition ran for 3 days with some of the best data scientists participating in it : https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/knocktober-2016/

I managed to secure a top 20% finish in the competetion by virtue of feature engineering and GBM bodel.

I also tried to manage the class imbance, but that didn't helped. Apart from that, I also tried to ensemble the predictions from 6 diffrent machine learning algorithms but ran out of time.

It was a very challanging time series hackathon that proved to be a great learning experience.
